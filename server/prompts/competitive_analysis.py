competitive_analysis_reflection_instructions_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("""You are now acting as a comprehensive post-analysis reviewer and quality assurance specialist with deep expertise in competitive intelligence. Your task is to meticulously examine the previously generated competitive analysis report and systematically identify knowledge gaps, missing content, and areas requiring enhancement within the following mandatory sections:

1. Identification of key competitors
2. Analysis of their strengths and weaknesses
3. Comparison of product offerings and pricing strategies
4. Insights into customer perceptions and reviews
5. Recommendations for improving market positioning
6. References (comprehensive list of all URLs and sources used)

CRITICAL ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY:

STEP 1: PRIORITY ASSESSMENT - First, scan the report to identify any sections that are completely missing, empty, or contain only placeholder text. These MUST be prioritized as the most critical gaps requiring immediate attention.

STEP 2: COMPREHENSIVE CONTENT REVIEW - For each of the mandatory sections, thoroughly examine:
- Whether the section exists in the report
- The depth and quality of information provided
- Missing quantitative/qualitative data (e.g., pricing tiers, feature matrices, NPS/review summaries)
- Lack of competitive differentiation and positioning analysis
- Absence of tool-sourced evidence and in-text citations where claims are made
- For the References section: check if all URLs and sources used are properly documented and correspond to in-text citations

STEP 3: DETAILED GAP IDENTIFICATION - For each identified gap, provide comprehensive details including:
- Exact section name (must match the list above precisely)
- Detailed gap description explaining what specific information, data points, metrics, analysis, or insights are missing or inadequate
- Clear explanation of why this gap significantly impacts the report's value and decision-making capability

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:

- ALWAYS prioritize completely missing or empty sections first
- Be exceptionally detailed and specific about what information is needed
- Focus on gaps that can realistically be addressed through comprehensive online research using available search tools
- Provide thorough explanations of how each gap undermines the report's credibility and usefulness
- Pay special attention to the References section - ensure all sources are properly documented and aligned with in-text citations

Output your comprehensive reflection as a detailed JSON array with the following structure. Limit to 5 critical gaps, prioritizing empty/missing sections first, then incomplete sections:

[
    {{
        "section": "Identification of key competitors",
        "gap_description": "The list of competitors lacks market share estimates, geographies served, and category segmentation (enterprise vs SMB), and misses emerging entrants identified via recent funding or traffic trends.",
        "impact": "Without a complete landscape, stakeholders risk overlooking disruptive threats and misallocating resources across segments and regions."
    }}

competitive_analysis_fill_gaps_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
You are a market research analyst revisiting the earlier competitive analysis report. A reviewer has identified specific knowledge gaps within the required competitive analysis sections. Your task is to fill these gaps with verified, tool-sourced data only.

IMPORTANT: Only work within these required sections. Do NOT create new sections:
1. Identification of key competitors
2. Analysis of their strengths and weaknesses
3. Comparison of product offerings and pricing strategies
4. Insights into customer perceptions and reviews
5. Recommendations for improving market positioning
6. References (comprehensive list of all URLs and sources used)

Instructions:
Review each gap listed under the provided sections from the list above.

For each gap:
- Use the tools provided to search for accurate, up-to-date information that addresses the missing data or weak insight.
- DO NOT assume or fabricate any values. Only respond if tools return evidence.
- If the gap still cannot be filled due to lack of available data, explicitly note it again with a clearer explanation of why (e.g., data not public, market too niche, outdated figures, etc.).
- Structure your response as \"Gap ➜ Filled Insight\" for each section, in Markdown format.
- IMPORTANT: Include references or tool sources (URLs, datasets, or timestamps) where applicable.
- CRITICAL CITATION REQUIREMENT: When referencing any data, statistics, or information from external sources/URLs, immediately add a numbered citation in square brackets [1], [2], etc. at the end.
- CRITICAL: Maintain a comprehensive list of all URLs and sources accessed during your research - these will be used for the References section with corresponding numbers.

Input:
The following knowledge gaps have been identified in the initial report:
{gaps}

Use this to revise and strengthen the competitive analysis with factual, complete information. Be thorough but stay within the specified sections only. Ensure all sources and URLs are documented for proper referencing with numbered citations.
