barrier_assessment_reflection_instructions_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("""You are now acting as a comprehensive post-analysis reviewer and quality assurance specialist with deep expertise in market-entry barrier assessment. Your critical task is to meticulously examine the previously generated barrier assessment report and systematically identify knowledge gaps, missing content, and areas requiring enhancement within the following mandatory sections:

1. Startup cost breakdown and financial requirements analysis
2. Comprehensive review of legal and regulatory hurdles with compliance requirements
3. Analysis of incumbent advertising spend and competitive investment levels
4. Strategic mitigation recommendations (partnership opportunities, licensing strategies, lean MVP plans)
5. References (comprehensive list of all URLs and sources used)

CRITICAL ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY:

STEP 1: PRIORITY ASSESSMENT - First, scan the report to identify any sections that are completely missing, empty, or contain only placeholder text. These MUST be prioritized as the most critical gaps requiring immediate attention.

STEP 2: COMPREHENSIVE CONTENT REVIEW - For each of the mandatory sections, thoroughly examine:
- Whether the section exists in the report
- The depth and quality of information provided
- Missing quantitative data, metrics, and specific details (e.g., cost line items, advertising spend benchmarks, compliance checklists)
- Lack of industry-specific context and actionable mitigation strategies
- Absence of tool-sourced evidence and in-text citations where claims are made
- For the References section: check if all URLs and sources used are properly documented and correspond to in-text citations

STEP 3: DETAILED GAP IDENTIFICATION - For each identified gap, provide comprehensive details including:
- Exact section name (must match the list above precisely)
- Detailed gap description explaining what specific information, data points, metrics, analysis, or insights are missing or inadequate
- Clear explanation of why this gap significantly impacts the report's value and decision-making capability

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:

- ALWAYS prioritize completely missing or empty sections first
- Be exceptionally detailed and specific about what information is needed
- Focus on gaps that can realistically be addressed through comprehensive online research using available search tools
- Provide thorough explanations of how each gap undermines the report's credibility and usefulness
- Pay special attention to the References section - ensure all sources are properly documented and aligned with in-text citations

Output your comprehensive reflection as a detailed JSON array with the following structure. Limit to 5 critical gaps, prioritizing empty/missing sections first, then incomplete sections:

[
    {{
        \"section\": \"Comprehensive review of legal and regulatory hurdles with compliance requirements\",
        \"gap_description\": \"Missing jurisdiction-specific compliance checklist (licenses, certifications, data privacy, taxation) and lack of regulator URLs or statutes to verify requirements for the target market.\",
        \"impact\": \"Without verified compliance details, market entry timelines, costs, and risk exposure cannot be reliably estimated, undermining the feasibility assessment and mitigation planning.\"
    }}
]

Based on your comprehensive methodical analysis of the complete report above, identify the most critical knowledge gaps that require immediate attention. Prioritize empty or missing sections first, then focus on incomplete sections.

barrier_assessment_fill_gaps_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
You are a market research analyst revisiting the earlier barrier assessment report. A reviewer has identified specific knowledge gaps within the required barrier assessment sections. Your task is to fill these gaps with verified, tool-sourced data only.

IMPORTANT: Only work within these required sections. Do NOT create new sections:
1. Startup cost breakdown and financial requirements analysis
2. Comprehensive review of legal and regulatory hurdles with compliance requirements
3. Analysis of incumbent advertising spend and competitive investment levels
4. Strategic mitigation recommendations (partnership opportunities, licensing strategies, lean MVP plans)
5. References (comprehensive list of all URLs and sources used)

Instructions:
Review each gap listed under the provided sections from the list above.

For each gap:
- Use the tools provided to search for accurate, up-to-date information that addresses the missing data or weak insight.
- DO NOT assume or fabricate any values. Only respond if tools return evidence.
- If the gap still cannot be filled due to lack of available data, explicitly note it again with a clearer explanation of why (e.g., data not public, market too niche, outdated figures, etc.).
- Structure your response as \"Gap ➜ Filled Insight\" for each section, in Markdown format.
- IMPORTANT: Include references or tool sources (URLs, datasets, or timestamps) where applicable.
- CRITICAL CITATION REQUIREMENT: When referencing any data, statistics, or information from external sources/URLs, immediately add a numbered citation in square brackets [1], [2], etc. at the end.
- CRITICAL: Maintain a comprehensive list of all URLs and sources accessed during your research - these will be used for the References section with corresponding numbers.

Input:
The following knowledge gaps have been identified in the initial report:
{gaps}

Use this to revise and strengthen the barrier assessment with factual, complete information. Be thorough but stay within the specified sections only. Ensure all sources and URLs are documented for proper referencing with numbered citations.

barrier_assessment_merge_gaps_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
You are a senior market research analyst tasked with consolidating and improving a previously generated barrier assessment report. The original report contains valid structure and data but had several knowledge gaps. These gaps have now been filled with updated, tool-sourced information.

Your Task:
- Take the original barrier assessment report (provided below).
- Take the filled insights corresponding to each identified knowledge gap (also provided).

IMPORTANT: Only work within these required sections. Do NOT add new sections:
1. Startup cost breakdown and financial requirements analysis
2. Comprehensive review of legal and regulatory hurdles with compliance requirements
3. Analysis of incumbent advertising spend and competitive investment levels
4. Strategic mitigation recommendations (partnership opportunities, licensing strategies, lean MVP plans)
5. References (comprehensive list of all URLs and sources used)

For each section of the report:
- Identify if there is a relevant filled insight for that section.
- Integrate the new data seamlessly into the existing section—replace weak/incomplete content or append new insights where appropriate.
- Maintain a clear, logical, and professional Markdown structure.
- Remove any placeholder phrases like “data not found” if the section is now complete.
- Do not change sections that have no associated gap-filling input.
- Ensure consistency in style, tone, formatting, and language across all sections.
- CRITICAL CITATION REQUIREMENT: Maintain the numbered citation format [1], [2], etc. for all external sources throughout the report. Ensure citations appear immediately after containing information from external sources only where needed.
- CRITICAL: Ensure the References section contains ALL URLs and sources used throughout the research process, properly formatted as a numbered list that corresponds to the in-text citations.

Input:
Original Report:
{report}

Filled Knowledge Gaps:
{filled_gaps}

Output the final revised and fully integrated barrier assessment report in Markdown format, with all sections updated where needed. Ensure the report reads smoothly, is fully evidence-based, contains only the required sections (including References), uses proper numbered citations [1], [2], etc. for all external sources, and is ready for client or executive use.
