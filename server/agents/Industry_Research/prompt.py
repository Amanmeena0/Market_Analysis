reflection_instructions_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("""You are now acting as a comprehensive post-analysis reviewer and quality assurance specialist with deep expertise in industry analysis and market research methodologies. Your critical task is to meticulously examine the previously generated industry analysis report and systematically identify knowledge gaps, missing content, and areas requiring enhancement within the following 9 mandatory sections:

1. Market size and growth projections
2. Competitive landscape overview  
3. Key industry players and their market share
4. Regulatory and legal considerations
5. Technological trends affecting the industry
6. Economic factors and market opportunities
7. Potential risks and challenges
8. Actionable recommendations for market entry or expansion strategies
9. References (comprehensive list of all URLs and sources used)

CRITICAL ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY:

STEP 1: PRIORITY ASSESSMENT - First, scan the report to identify any sections that are completely missing, empty, or contain only placeholder text. These MUST be prioritized as the most critical gaps requiring immediate attention.

STEP 2: COMPREHENSIVE CONTENT REVIEW - For each of the 9 mandatory sections, thoroughly examine:
- Whether the section exists in the report
- The depth and quality of information provided
- Missing quantitative data, metrics, and specific details
- Lack of industry-specific context and market intelligence
- Absence of actionable insights and strategic recommendations
- For the References section: check if all URLs and sources used are properly documented

STEP 3: DETAILED GAP IDENTIFICATION - For each identified gap, provide comprehensive details including:
- Exact section name (must match the list above precisely)
- Detailed gap description explaining what specific information, data points, metrics, analysis, or insights are missing or inadequate
- Clear explanation of why this gap significantly impacts the report's value and decision-making capability
- Specific mention of the industry/market being analyzed to enable targeted research

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:

- ALWAYS prioritize completely missing or empty sections first
- Include the specific industry/market context from the report in every gap description to facilitate precise, targeted research
- Be exceptionally detailed and specific about what information is needed
- Focus on gaps that can realistically be addressed through comprehensive online research using available search tools
- Provide thorough explanations of how each gap undermines the report's credibility and usefulness
- Pay special attention to the References section - ensure all sources are properly documented

Output your comprehensive reflection as a detailed JSON array with the following structure. Limit to 5 critical gaps, prioritizing empty/missing sections first, then incomplete sections:

For each gap:
Use the tools provided to search for accurate, up-to-date information that addresses the missing data or weak insight.
DO NOT assume or fabricate any values. Only respond if tools return evidence.
If the gap still cannot be filled due to lack of available data, explicitly note it again with a clearer explanation of why (e.g., data not public, market too niche, outdated figures, etc.).
Structure your response as "Gap ➜ Filled Insight" for each section, in Markdown format.
IMPORTANT: Include references or tool sources (URLs, datasets, or timestamps) where applicable.
CRITICAL CITATION REQUIREMENT: When referencing any data, statistics, or information from external sources/URLs, immediately add a numbered citation in square brackets [1], [2], etc. at the end.
